# Introduction
This is the 4th project for the Python path of Openclassrooms. The goal is to Develop a Software Program Using Python
wich is capable to do the follwing things:
1. Create and manage a database with data of saved players and tournaments
2. Run a Tournament using the "Swiss" tournament system and produce reports


# Required Setup to run the program:

1. Python version 3.9.5 or higher must be installed.
2. Create the directory in which you want to keep the program.
3. Open your terminal.
4. Navigate to the folder with the "chess_club_app" folder and requirements.txt
5. Create your Virtual Environment by running the command: `python -m venv .venv`
6. Activate the Environment by running: `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (Windows) or `source .venv/bin/activate` (OS)
7. Install the Requirements by running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
# How to run the program:
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to the directory which contains "chess_club_app"
3. Activate the environment by running: `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (Windows) or `source .venv/bin/activate` (OS)
4. Run the command: python -m chess_club_app
   
## Notes
- The program will create a database folder and file automatically

## Technologies
